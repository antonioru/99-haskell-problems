# ðŸŽ± 99-haskell-problems

A series of 99 (unfortunate) Haskell problems, with possible solutions. 

### Why? 

This repository is meant to be a Haskell playground to possibly learn the language. <br />
It contains 99 problems from [Ninety Nine Haskell Problems](https://wiki.haskell.org/H-99:_Ninety-Nine_Haskell_Problems) that we tried to solve at the best of our possibilities. <br />
